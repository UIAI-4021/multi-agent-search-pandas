## Overview

This project focuses on implementing AI strategies for the classic game Pac-Man. It incorporates elements of reinforcement learning and game playing algorithms.

## Features

- **Minimax Algorithm with Alpha-Beta Pruning**: Implements Minimax with alpha-beta pruning to enhance the efficiency of the search algorithm.

- **Multi-Agent Environment**: The project includes a multi-agent environment where Pac-Man interacts with intelligent ghosts.

## Usage

To use the environment, follow these steps after cloning the GitHub repository:

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/pacman-ai-project.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the directory `multi-agent-search-pandas\Code\multiagent` using the terminal:

    ```bash
    cd pacman-ai-project/multi-agent-search-pandas/Code/multiagent
    ```

3. Run the following script to play the game:

    ```bash
    python play_game.py
    ```

4. Run the following script to play against intelligent ghosts:

    ```bash
    python play_against_ghosts.py
    ```

5. Run the following script to increase the number of ghosts:

    ```bash
    python increase_ghosts.py
    ```

6. Run the following script for manual play mode:

    ```bash
    python manual_play.py
    ```
